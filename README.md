# Flashcards (Go)

This is a project for the Jetbrains Academy Golang track.

## Tasks

* Display information about a single card on the screen
* Compare the lines and work with conditions: display the card and user's answer on the screen
* Practice arrays and loops: create a new card for the program to play with you
* Learn to use hashtables, display key values, and work with exceptions in order to fix the problem of repeating cards
* Work with files: create a menu that allows you to add, delete, save, and upload saved cards in your game
* Using statistics, set a correct answer for each card and teach the game to determine which card was the hardest to solve
* Enable the user to import files right upon starting the game, working with command-line arguments
